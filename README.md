## IMPLEMENTATION OF PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION FOR VIDEO GAME AGENT DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT
### Academic Project for Artificial Intelligence subject

Particle swarm optimization 
(PSO) is a bio-inspired algorithm that searches 
for the best solution without relying on gradients 
or complex mathematical forms, which mimics a 
flock of birds. This nature led to the thought of 
using PSO for video game agent directional 
movement. By incorporating a Particle swarm 
manager where each particle is an enemy agent 
(zombie, bug, alien, etc.) partnered with arcade 
style mechanics, we developed a game where 
enemy agent movements were unpredictable and 
erratic. The results of the implementation were 
highly satisfactory, with all enemy types, 
including zombies, bugs, and aliens, being able to 
pursue the player realistically and engagingly. 
The PSO manager for the zombie enemies was 
particularly successful, recalculating their 
directions for accurate pursuit. However, a 
limitation was observed when the PSO population 
size was low, resulting in less effective enemy 
behavior. However, a limitation was observed 
when the PSO population size was low, resulting 
in less effective enemy behavior. This limitation is 
inherent to PSO, where a larger population size
generally leads to better optimization results.
